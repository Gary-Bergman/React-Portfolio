       MERN Stack developer with a background in sales and marketing looking to contribute as a web developer to a JavaScript oriented team. Recent graduate of the intensive, full-time Penn LPS full stack coding bootcamp, with acquired skills including JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, jQuery, Bootstrap, Foundation and Materialize. As a former marketing specialist, I have a knack for framing and design, which translates perfectly to a Jr. Front-End Developer position. I have experiencing designing and building full stack web applications, including working on a four-person team to develop an application, using MVC architecture, to connect parents with teachers in learning pods for small-group tutoring during the Covid-19 pandemic. I was the lead designer for our project, TeachPod, and created the application to be fully mobile-responsive. Iâ€™m looking forward to translating my skills to a JavaScript role to build clean, sleek and proficient websites.
