                I'm a Full Stack Developer in training based in Philadelphia, PA. I run a small event marketing
                company, Local Amp LLC, but decided to take up coding to increase my marketable skill sets.
                Outside of work I love to play Ultimate, video games, board games and guitar! I have only been
                coding for a few months now, but I love it! I'd like to incorporate creative problem solving
                into my next junior developer role after graduating from the Penn BootCamp!
